            <img src="Resources/Images/th.jpg" alt="" style="float: left;padding-right: 10px;" />Shrek , a grouchy, terrifying green ogre who has always enjoyed living in peaceful solitude in his swamp, finds his life utterly interrupted when numerous fairytale characters are exiled into his swamp by order of the obsessive, evil, fairy-tale hating Lord Farquaad . Shrek announces to the fairytale creatures that he will go to see Farquaad to move them out of his swamp and back to where they came from. Shrek brings along a talking Donkey . Meanwhile, Farquaad tortures the Gingerbread Man into revealing the whereabouts of the remaining fairytale creatures until his guards rush in with an object Farquaad has been searching for: the Magic Mirror. Farquaad asks The Mirror if his kingdom is the fairest of them all, but is told that he is not actually a king. The Mirror tells Farquaad that he can only become a real king by marrying a princess, and gives him three princesses to choose from, in a parody of The Dating Game: Cinderella, Snow White, and Princess Fiona , from which Farquaad chooses Fiona, who is locked in a tower guarded by lava and a fire-breathing dragon. The Mirror tells him that he shouldn't mention "the little thing that happens at night", which is later revealed to be a curse. Shrek and Donkey arrive at Farquaad's palace in Duloc, where they find themselves in the midst of a tournament. The winner will have the "privilege" of attempting to rescue Fiona so that Farquaad may marry her. Shrek, with some help from Donkey, easily defeats the other knights in a fashion that resembles a wrestling match and Farquaad agrees to remove the fairytale creatures from the swamp if Shrek rescues Fiona.</p>

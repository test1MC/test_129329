            <img src="Resources/Images/shrek_princess_fiona.jpg" title="Fiona1" alt="Fiona" style="float: left;padding-right: 10px;" />Fiona first appears as an option for a princess bride selected by Lord Farquaad, who desires to become a king in order to access dominant authority, in order to accomplish this dream. Ignoring warnings of a secret possessed by Fiona, Farquaad proceeds with his plan and decides to search for the woman so he may marry her and become a king, though she is soon encountered by Donkey and Shrek, and at first the group holds hateful feelings towards one another. However, late one night, Donkey learns that because of a magical spell that had been cast on her years before, Fiona transforms into an ogress every night, but by morning reverts to her regular human form. Eventually, Shrek and Fiona start to warm up to each other and perhaps even begin to fall in love, but this is interrupted when Shrek and Fiona get into a misunderstanding followed by Shrek bringing Lord Farquaad to get Fiona, who then proceed to a marriage. Shrek and Donkey interrupt Fiona's wedding ceremony and try to cancel any possibilities of her wedding Lord Farquaad, and her ogre transformation spell is triggered and manages to appall Farquaad into losing desires of marrying her. At the end of the movie, Shrek marries Fiona and Farquaad is swallowed by Donkey's new girlfriend, Dragon.</p>
